## Self-introduction

My name is Max, I'm 20 years old, and I'm a junior frontend developer. 

I am currently studying in the second year of BSTU "Voenmeh" in St. Petersburg at the Faculty of Software Development. Also, I'm currently attending an RSSchool front-end course. 

I started learning web development in the summer of 2022. At first, I studied everything on my own, made several projects. But in October I heard about this course from my friend and decided to try my hand at it.  

Despite the knowledge I had, I decided that I needed to take a pre-school course first. Having completed it in the first position with the maximum score, I started studying stage 1 with full confidence.

It was hard at times, but the desire to be the best at what I do and the support of close people did not allow me to give up. As a result, almost all tasks are completed with the maximum score. 

And I'm not going to stop, because it's better to work on knowledge now so that knowledge starts working for you later.
